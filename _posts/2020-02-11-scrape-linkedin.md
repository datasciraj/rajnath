# Scrape [linkedin.com](www.linkedin.com) post using Python

Good linkedin profile is handy in job search and creating professional network. There is option to search job on linkedin, but often recruiters post job opening. In such cases simple linkedin job search will not fetch these details. But there is option to do content search to find such cases. I tried scraping content based on keyword using python, selenium and beautifulsoup.

Let us start with downloading chromewebdriver.

In progress.

Happy learning.
