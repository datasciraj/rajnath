Important topics in Q&A format is based on my experience. Feel free to update me in case of any observation or you want to add anything.

##### 1. How to debug pip installation error?
For debugging purpose, pip displays some installation message on console. It also offers ways to control console level log by -v,--verbose, -q and --quiet. Full log can be saved by providing --log option with file path, it will have complete installation log. There are cases where currupt download also creates issues at the time of installation, in that case try --no-cache-dir. If that also does not work then you can always try the installation from source file.

##### 2. Difference between list and dictionary?
###### List
* List in Python is a heterogeneous container for items.
* Elements present in List maintain their order.
* The elements present in list can be of any type (int, float, string, tuple etc.).
* Elements are accessed through their index values.
* If you have a collection of data that does not need random access, use List.
* Where you have to deal with values which can be changed, use List.
```python
mylist=[1,2,3,'4','sample']
```
###### Dictionary
* Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
* Dictionaries are used to handle large amount of data.
* Every element is having a key-value pair.
* Elements are accessed by using itâ€™s key value.
* When you are dealing with unique keys and you are mapping values to the keys, use Dictionary.
```python
mydict = {1:'Python'}
```

##### 3. How to read 10 characters from a file?
```python
f = open('<file name>','r')
print(f.read(10))
```

##### 4. What are membership operators in Python? Write an example to explain both.
There are 2 types of membership operators in Python:  
in: If the value is found in a sequence, then the result becomes true else false  
not in: If the value is not found in a sequence, then the result becomes true else false  
```python
a=15
b=30
list = [3,6,15,20,25]

if (a in list):
	print('a is available in given list')
else:
	print('a is not available in given list')

 
if ( b not in list ):
	print('b is not available in given list')
else:
	print('b is available in given list')
```

##### 5. Command to get all keys from the dictionary.
```python
mydict = {1:'Raj',2:'Som'}
print(mydict.keys())
```

##### 6. What is monkey patching?
Monkey patching means adding a new variable or method to a class or module after it's been defined.  
Example: We define a class A as
```python
class A(object):
    def __init__(self, num):
        self.num = num

    def __add__(self, other):
        return A(self.num + other.num)
```
But now we want to add another function later in the code like below.
```python
def get_num(self):
    return self.num	
```
To do this as method of class A at runtime, we assign the function to class like below.  
```python
A.get_num = get_num
```
At runtime, assign the new method and use new methos like below.
```python
foo = A(42)
A.get_num = get_num
bar = A(6);
foo.get_num() # 42
bar.get_num() # 6
```
