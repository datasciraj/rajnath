# Flask CRUD Demo Application

Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.  

I have devloped sample demo CRUD application with login and logout option. Application can be downloaded from github repo [flask crud](https://github.com/rajnathsah/CrudFlask).

For developing this application, i have used pycharm ide, but it is not necessary, You can pick any ide or editor of your choice. If you are working on flask framework for the first time then it is suggested to refer the official documentaion of [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/). Refer this and try, this will help in getting started with flask application. Once you have some idea about flask then you can download my application code and follow along to develop the same application.  

After completion of this application, you will have understanding of flask, jinja template, sqlalchemy, login, validation and blueprint.

Let us start the development by creating the directory structure as follow  
CrudFlask/  
          instance/  
          app/  
            admin/  
            auth/  
            home/  
            static/  
            templates/  


Happy learning.
