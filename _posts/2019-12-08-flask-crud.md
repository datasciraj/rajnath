# Flask CRUD Demo Application

Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications. It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.  

I have devloped sample demo CRUD application with login and logout option. Application can be downloaded from github repo [flask crud](https://github.com/rajnathsah/CrudFlask).

Happy learning.
