Updating profile daily increases the probablity of getting noticed by recruiters on job portal. Using OneClick resume upload hack, job search can be made easy by keeping profile updated easily on [naukri.com](www.naukri.com), [naukrigulf.com](www.naukrigulf.com) [monsterIndia.com](www.monsterindia.com) and [monstergulf.com](www.monstergulf.com).

It is easy to configure and run. It can also be scheduled to run on personal computer.  

Setup is very easy and can be done in three steps:  

* Have updated chrome browser installed.
