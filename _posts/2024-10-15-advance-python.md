In this post, we will continue our learning from basic to advance topics of python.  

1.  Deep Dive into Data Structures:
    *  Understand advanced data structures like heaps, linked lists, and trees.
    *  Learn about collections module (e.g., deque, Counter, defaultdict).
    *  Resources:
        *  [Python Data Structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
        *  [Collections Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)

2.  Advanced Functions:
    *  Master higher-order functions, lambda functions, and functional programming concepts.
    *  Explore decorators and their use cases.
    *  Resources:
        *  [Python Decorators](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/)
        *  [Functional Programming in Python](https://realpython.com/python-functional-programming/)

3.  Iterators and Generators:
    *  Learn about iterators and the iterator protocol.
    *  Understand generators and generator expressions for efficient looping.
    *  Resources:
