# Python
In this post, we will continue our learning from basic to advance topics of python.  

1.  Deep Dive into Data Structures:
    *  Understand advanced data structures like heaps, linked lists, and trees.
    *  Learn about collections module (e.g., deque, Counter, defaultdict).
    *  Resources:
        *  [Python Data Structures](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)
        *  [Collections Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html)

2.  Advanced Functions:
    *  Master higher-order functions, lambda functions, and functional programming concepts.
    *  Explore decorators and their use cases.
    *  Resources:
        *  [Python Decorators](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/)
        *  [Functional Programming in Python](https://realpython.com/python-functional-programming/)

3.  Iterators and Generators:
    *  Learn about iterators and the iterator protocol.
    *  Understand generators and generator expressions for efficient looping.
    *  Resources:
        *  [Iterators and Iterables](https://realpython.com/python-itertools/)
        *  [Generators](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/)
          
4.  Context Managers:
    *  Use context managers to manage resources with with statements.
    *  Create custom context managers using contextlib.
    *  Resources:
        *  [Context Managers and the with Statement](https://realpython.com/python-with-statement/)
        *  [Contextlib Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html)

5.  Metaprogramming:
    *  Understand metaclasses and their applications.
    *  Explore dynamic code generation and manipulation.
    *  Resources:
        *  [Metaclasses in Python]
        *  [Dynamic Code Generation]

6.  Concurrency and Parallelism:
    *  Learn about threading, multiprocessing, and asynchronous programming with asyncio.
    *  Understand the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and its implications.
    *  Resources:
         *   [Concurrency in Python](https://realpython.com/python-concurrency/)
         *   [Asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)

7.  Networking and Web Development:
    *  Dive into network programming with socket and asyncio.
    *  Explore web frameworks like Flask, Django, and FastAPI for building web applications.
    *  Resources:
         *   [Network Programming](https://realpython.com/python-sockets/)
         *   [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
