# Oracle Sql and Pl/Sql concepts and Q&A
I will try to add all the important topics in Q&A format based on my experience. Feel free to update me in case of any observation or you want to add anything. This post is specific to technical concepts.

##### 1. SQL Query processing    
Order of SQL query processing in Oracle database.  
  * FROM 
  * CONNECT BY 
  * WHERE 
  * GROUP BY 
  * HAVING 
  * SELECT 
  * ORDER BY
  
##### 2. How does database processes sql statement
  * SQL parsing (Includes syntax check, semantic check and shared pool check)
  * SQL optimization
  * SQL row source generation
  * Execution

##### 3. SQL Parsing
SQL parsing involves separating the pieces of a SQL statement into a data structure that other routines can process. During the parsing database performs following checks.  
  * Syntax check
    check each SQL statement for syntactic validity.    
  * Semantic check
    A semantic check determines whether a statement is meaningful, for example, whether the objects and columns in the statement exist.
  * Shared pool check
    Database performs a shared pool check to determine whether it can skip resource-intensive steps of statement processing.When a user submits a SQL statement, the database searches the shared SQL area to see if an existing parsed statement has the same hash value. Based on result of hash check, it follows below.
    * Hard Parse
    * Soft Parse
