# Scrape [Naukri.com](www.naukri.com) job using Scrapy

# Scrapy
An open source and collaborative framework for extracting the data you need from websites.

Using scrapy you can scrape data and save it in the any format you wish to. For demo, i have scraped [naukri.com](www.naukri.com) and searched python jobs in Hyderabad. Xpath understanding will be handy while defining the selectors. You can setup a path to save scraped files. Scrapy allows you to deploy the job easily using scrapyd, it is very intutive and userfriendly.  

Please refer [demo](https://github.com/rajnathsah/naukriscraper) github repo for details.  

Happy learning.
