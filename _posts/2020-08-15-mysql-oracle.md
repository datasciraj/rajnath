## MySQL
MySQL is an open-source database management system. It uses a relational database and SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage its data.

## Oracle always free cloud instance
Oracle provides true always free cloud instance with very configuration for starting with. You can view the list of services available in this tier on [always free details](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/#always-free). To start with, you need to go to [Oracle’s Cloud Free Tier website](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/) and register. You need to give your email and other details including payment methods, but you won’t be charged as long as you choose the Oracle Cloud free-tier products.

## Create compute instance
Once account registration is done, then login to your cloud console and create vm instance. To create vm instance, click on the “Create a VM instance” box.
Follow the steps and pick the default selected image of Oracle Linux and in network/storage option select "ASSIGN A PUBLIC IP ADDRESS". In add SSH keys section, select "GENERATE SSH KEYS" and save both public and private keys safely in your local machine.  

Note : SSH keys will be shown only at the time of instance creation so be careful and save private keys.  

## Login to compute instance
Once instance is created, navigate to below and copy the IP address.    
Compute -> Instances -> Instance Details  
Using this public ip address, login to cloud instance from putty. For logging to cloud instance using putty, you have to use private ssh keys which you should have saved in previous steps.

## Installing MySQL
MySQL installation is pretty simple but on Oracle linux MariaDB is the default version of MySQL which gets installed on running below command.
```shell
sudo yum install mysql 
```
